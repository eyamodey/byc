                Network Marketing, also known as Multilevel Marketing(MLM), is a type of business model
                employed by some companies in which they encourage their existing distributors to not only stop at retailing
                the company's products but also recruit new distributors. By so doing these existing distributors get paid
                a percentage of whatever sales/purshases made by their recruits, thereby making extra income in addition
                to the profits being made by them from direct sales of the company's products to customers.
                Indeed, network marketing is one of the easiest ways to build passive income because, when done correctly,
                overtime your network begins to generate a flow of income with minimal effort from you. But the
                challenge lies in recognising genuine network marketing opportunities.

                <br> <br>
                <h6> <strong> Understanding Network Marketing </strong> </h6>
                In Nigeria, and indeed the world over, there is some stigma attached to the term <mark>network marketing</mark> due
                to the fact that most people have lost huge amounts of money in Ponzi and pyramid schemes masquerading as
                network marketing businesses. And the fact that most network marketing models are built like a pyramid -
                but they are NOT pyramid schemes - makes it difficult to differentiate them from Ponzi/pyramid schemes.

                <br><br>
                Companies that adopt the network marketing model create levels of distributors, known as uplines, who are
                then encouraged to create their own network of distributors (downlines). With this arrangement, every
                distributor makes a commission on their own sales/purchases and also on the sales/purchases of their
                downlines. The more downlines engage in product sales/purchases, the more commission earned by their
                uplines. Therefore, the earnings of distributors in any network marketing business depends on recruitment
                as well as product sales. <br> <br>

                <h6> <strong>Network Marketing vs Ponzi/Pyramid schemes</strong> </h6>
                One thing to use in determining whether a business model is truly network marketing is whether it sells
                real products, and if these products are sold primarily to consumers or to its existing members who must
                recruit new members to buy their products. If the former, it is likely a legitimate network marketing
                business. But if the latter, then it most likely is a Ponzi/pyramid scheme that makes money only by selling
                expensive starter kits to new members.

                You can quickly detect pyramid schemes by their greater focus on recruitment than on product sales. They
                use money from new members to pay people at the top rather than those who perform the work. <br> <br>

                Here is an excerpt from an article I found online that explains it perfectly.
                <p>
                <span style="color: #ff0000;">
                "Both Ponzi schemes and pyramids are quite seductive because they may be able to deliver a high rate of return
                to a few early investors for a short period of time. Yet, both pyramid and Ponzi schemes are illegal because
                they inevitably must fall apart. No program can recruit new members forever. Every pyramid or Ponzi scheme
                collapses because it cannot expand beyond the size of the earth's population. When the scheme collapses,
                most investors find themselves at the bottom, unable to recoup their losses.
                Some people confuse pyramid and Ponzi schemes with legitimate multilevel marketing. Multilevel marketing
                programs are known as MLM's, and unlike pyramid or Ponzi schemes, MLM's have a real product to sell.
                More importantly, MLM's actually sell their product to members of the general public, without requiring
                these consumers to pay anything extra or to join the MLM system. MLM's may pay commissions to a long string
                of distributors, but these commissions are paid for real retail sales, not for new recruits."

                <h6> <strong>Common Misconceptions About Network Marketing </strong> </h6>
                Most people joining a network marketing business usually make two mistakes that if not quickly handled
                will inevitably lead to them failing in the business.
                <ol>
                  <li>People think they are joining the business to make others rich.</li>
                  <li>People think it is the responsibility of the person who introduced them to the business to make them earn.</li>
                </ol>
                The truth is, in building any type of business you can not avoid enriching those that are already a part of
                that business chain. The same thing applies in network marketing, those already in it before you <b>will</b>
                definitely benefit from your efforts. And just as you would not buy a franchise and expect it to run itself
                so you can not be a member of a Network Marketing Company and expect it to run itself. You are building your
                <em>OWN</em> business. The person that introduced you just shared a way of making extra money. In order to
                make this money you ought to put in the work. If you must make network marketing business your ticket to
                financial freedom then you have to enter it with the correct mindset.
                <br> <br>

                <h6> <strong>Things to Consider Before Joining any Network Marketing Business</strong> </h6>
                In my experience, and drawing from those of others I know, the following criteria will help you determine if an opportunity
                is truly a worthwhile network marketing model. Anyone looking to join a network marketing business should
                do some serious research before deciding. You can start by asking these questions:
                <ul>
                  <li>Are real products being promoted?</li>
                  <li>Are you, or anyone you know, enthusiastic about the products?</li>
                  <li>Do you have the sole right of choosing what products you want?</li>
                  <li>Is it being promoted as a means of making money through product sales or by recruiting others?</li>
                  <li>Is there some registration fee to be paid?</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Summary</strong>
                <p>
                Network marketing is not a fast money venture, you have to work at it just like every other business that you
                would want to be generating at least six figure monthly income.
                Having the right answers to the above questions will, to a large extent, ensure you don't get conned into
                putting your hard earned cash in any of the Ponzi/pyramid schemes being floated today. And should you require help
                with all or any of the questions, reach out to me on any of our social media handles.
