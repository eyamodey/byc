                In the late 1960s, Marshall McLuhan speculated that TV and other new telecommunications technologies were
                transforming the world into a “global village.” Events since have shown that McLuhan’s assertion was on target.
                An onslaught of mass media then, and lately a new wave of digital technologies typified by the internet, seemed
                indeed to be shrinking the world into a single community. <br> <br>

                Nikola Tesla had also stated in the year 1926 and I quote, "When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth
                will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole.
                We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through
                television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite
                intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will
                be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket."
                <br> <br>

                Isn’t it sad that most of us in this millennium, living right in the middle of the unfolding of these predictions,
                are oblivious of it? We seem to have not been able to harness the power of technology in our everyday living:
                business, job, education, hobby, family etc. Most don’t even know how to use a computer system!
                <br> <br>

                <strong>What is Technology?</strong> <br> <br>

                It is the study, development, and application of devices, machines, and techniques for manufacturing and
                productive processes.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft® Encarta®.</strong>
                The focus of this article would be to stress the “application” part of this definition and leave the others to
                governments and organizations with the know-how and resources to really engage in that regard. <br> <br>

                Points To Note
                <ul>
                  <li>Technology is no longer a luxury to be enjoyed by an elite few but a requirement necessary for surviving
                    in this age.</li>
                  <li>Technology has always existed and is always evolving. Only those who are able to evolve with the changing
                    technology will dominate in their niche.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>WHY EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY?</strong> <br> <br>

                There was a time when there was no cash; all trade was done by barter. At that time the quantity of goods exchanged for
                someone else’s goods or services was a function of the value placed on such by one or both parties. Today, money is what
                is mainly being exchanged for value; hence the real money is the VALUE it is being exchanged for. People pay for value;
                therefore to attract more money (better reward) you must increase your value. And there is no better way to increase
                value in any area other than the application of relevant technology.
                <p><img class="textwrap-left" src="../images/the-need-to-embrace-technology2.jpg" alt="hand typing on a laptop">
                  Your value is a function of your training and/or talent, tools and time i.e. <br>
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Training / Talent + Tools + Time = REWARD.</span>
                  <p>How much you are able to apply technology to these three elements determines what reward men give to you. And this is
                    because the world is now a “global village” by virtue of the internet which has moved us from physical to virtual
                    transactions and interactions. Technology has transformed life from being sequential to being concurrent.</p>
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>TRAINING / TALENT</li>

                  Until you are bigger than where you are now you cannot move up. It does not matter the level of training you have or the
                  ‘extraordinary’ talent you possess, if you don’t continually improve you will soon become irrelevant.
                  <img class="textwrap-right" src="../images/the-need-to-embrace-technology3.jpg" alt=""> That is why you are required to
                  continually update your software (though it can be annoying sometimes as in the case of WhatsApp), so as to access new
                  features that bring improved functionality. In the civil service, employees have to write, and pass, promotion exams
                  before they can be promoted. Even in the private sector, an employee must show improvement either in recent certifications
                  obtained or experience gained to be eligible for promotion. <br>

                  A mechanic that only knows how to fix vehicles with manual transmission must upgrade his knowledge or risk being out of
                  work by the time automatic transmission vehicles fully take over the vehicle transportation business. And how about the
                  transition from petrol/diesel powered vehicles to electric cars, any persons or organizations involved in the design,
                  development, manufacturing, marketing, selling, fueling, and even repair of vehicles must engage necessary
                  research and/or training to take advantage of this transition or risk being put out of business. You can imagine my
                  dismay when I read about the Nigerian senate rejecting a bill that sought to introduce electric cars in the country.
                  Read it <a href="https://t.guardian.ng/property/groups-flay-senate-for-rejecting-electric-cars/">here</a> for
                  yourself. <br>

                  Last word: If you are not updated you will be outdated; get relevant training now! <br> <br>

                  <li>TOOL</li>

                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">If the ax is dull and the man does not whet the edge, he must put forth more
                    strength; but wisdom helps him to succeed. – Ecclesiastes 10:10 AMP (The Holy Bible).</span>

                  <img class="textwrap-left" src="../images/the-need-to-embrace-technology4.jpg" alt="hands reaching towards the
                sky typing on a laptop"> <br> In today’s society, from a global perspective, technology has changed how individuals
                  function with each other as well as how business is now conducted. Whatever one is engaged in there is an aspect of
                  technology that can serve as a tool for enhancement. <br> It is Abraham Lincoln that said, “Give me 6 hours to chop down
                  a tree and I will spend the first 4 sharpening the axe.” For example, advertising has transitioned from word-of-mouth
                  through to posters/flyers, radio, television and now the internet. Any business that is involved with advertising today
                  must be able to find ways to engage through the internet else it will be run over by its competition. With the advancement
                  in cell phone technology and mobile apps, the internet has had far reaching effects in business than any other medium.

                  <br>I recently came across a mobile app from
                  <a href="https://one.jumia.com.ng/referrals/?invitedby=e4ee924b-5c58-4dac-8b49-673eee28dce0">jumia</a> that has made life
                  easier for me. Before now, anytime I needed to recharge my phone, pay for electricity or TV subscription etc., I had to
                  go look for a vendor (which is a waste of valuable time and money – as per service charge) or go online and transact
                  through my bank (a waste of money – as per service charge). But with this app I do everything from my android phone at
                  no cost except maybe the cost of data, and the best part is I get 4% cash back on every airtime and data transactions!
                  If you live in Nigeria or any of the West African countries you can check it out
                  <a href="https://one.jumia.com.ng/referrals/?invitedby=e4ee924b-5c58-4dac-8b49-673eee28dce0">here</a>. You even enjoy up
                  to 20% cash back on your first transaction when you enter the code WELCOME20.

                  <li>TIME</li>

                  <img class="textwrap-left" src="../images/the-need-to-embrace-technology5.jpg" alt="hands reaching towards the
                sky typing on a laptop">It used to be said, and believed, that SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE but all thanks to
                  Technology this is no longer the case. If you intend to stand any chance of winning a "race" today then the philosophy
                  to apply is SPEED AND ACCURACY WINS THE RACE. This is saying that the employment of technology in any venture leads to
                  increased speed of delivery as well as enhanced quality of delivery. For example, as a mechanical building services
                  engineer I remember how laborious it was then doing designs on paper but with the knowledge and use of design softwares
                  like <a href="#">AutoCAD</a>, design is now less time consuming and very much enjoyable. <br>

                  I also remember being given a
                  <a href="https://c.jumia.io/?a=120379&amp;c=11&amp;p=r&amp;E=kkYNyk2M4sk%3D&amp;ckmrdr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jumia.com.ng%2Fhome-kitchen%2F%3Fq%3DPressure%2520pot&amp;utm_campaign=120379">pressure pot</a> as
                  a wedding gift which my wife and I simply stowed away for more than a year until the day we realized it could save us time,
                  and cooking gas/kerosene, when cooking foods that take long to get done like beans (I love eating beans! hahahaha) – it
                  practically gets the job done in less than half the usual time. And using it is quite straight forward too. Check out
                  these ones on
                  <a href="https://c.jumia.io/?a=120379&amp;c=11&amp;p=r&amp;E=kkYNyk2M4sk%3D&amp;ckmrdr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jumia.com.ng%2Fhome-kitchen%2F%3Fq%3DPressure%2520pot&amp;utm_campaign=120379">jumia.com</a>, and thank me later.

                  <br>Last word: Technology gives you back your time, and with more time comes better productivity.

                  <strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Technology assumes minimum 12 hours power supply.</li>
                    <li>Technology assumes 24/7 online ability.</li>
                    <li>Technology can be abused.</li>
                    <li>Technology should not be resisted.</li>
                    <li>Find the technology that suits you and embrace it.</li>
                  </ol>
                  Someone once told me in a seminar, “When you are born you look like your parents, when you are old you look
                  like your decisions.” Make the decision to embrace technology today. Remember it is never too late to
                  change!

                </ol>
